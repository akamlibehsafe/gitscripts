I am standardizing and improving documenation about the project in order to capture context from Cursor as much as possible to the Repo. 

I need to create

CHANGELOG.md: user-facing “what changed” per release.

docs/decisions/ (ADRs): short records of important technical/product decisions (“why we did X instead of Y”).

docs/runbook.md (or docs/ops/…): install/uninstall, troubleshooting, recovery steps, and “gotchas”.

docs/ai-context.md: a concise, living briefing for any new machine/human/agent.

Here are some templates

ADR template (put in docs/decisions/0001-title.md)
# 0001 - <Decision title>
 
## Status
Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated
 
## Context
What problem are we solving? What constraints matter?
 
## Decision
What did we decide?
 
## Alternatives considered
- Option A: pros/cons
- Option B: pros/cons
 
## Consequences
What becomes easier/harder? What risks remain?
 
## Links
PRs, issues, docs, chats (if any)


docs/ai-context.md (living “briefing”)
# AI / Contributor Context (gitscripts)
 
## Goal
What this repo is for, in 2–5 bullets.
 
## Key workflows
- Install:
- Uninstall:
- Create from local/remote:
- Push flow:
 
## Repo layout
- scripts/: what each major script does
- config/: what lives here
 
## Invariants / rules
- Compatibility (macOS/Linux?)
- Shell assumptions (bash/zsh)
- Safety rules (no destructive ops without prompts, backups, etc.)
 
## Known sharp edges
- Common failure modes + fixes
 
## Current priorities
What’s next / what not to change



CHANGELOG.md (keep it release-oriented)
# Changelog
 
## Unreleased
- (Keep short; move to a release when you tag)
 
## 0.3.0 - 2026-01-15
### Added
- ...
### Changed
- ...
### Fixed

### Breaking

==================

How to I automate the filling of such docs as I keep working on the development?
